# Description

    This is a Portfolio of some of the work I have completed over three months at UWBootcamp. It shows you a piece of who I am and my Journey of confience throughout this program using React!

# Motivation

    I wanted to see how far I have come and while still test myself by using a couple of new programs.

# Usage

    To showcase my work and see how far I have come. 

# Future

    I think to embeleish it with more animations microinteractions, bring more stylistic elements to the page as well as dark mode. 

# Contributors

I have grabbed inspiration from [G Robit](https://codepen.io/grohit) on codepen as well as [David Fitas](https://codepen.io/dfitzy).
